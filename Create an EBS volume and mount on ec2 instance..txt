Create an EBS volume and mount on ec2 instance.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Create an EC2 instance.
Step 2: Go to the volume section and click on create volume.
Step 3: Click the action button after selecting the volume, and then choose the attach button.

Note:-Verify that the instance and the EBS volume are in the same availability zone.   

Step 4: Go to Mobaxterm and take a ssh of ec2-instance.

Note: - Now use the instructions below to connect to the root.
	*sudo su -  ---->Enter
Step 5: You can now list the disk available on your EC2 instance by firing the below command.
	*lsblk --->Enter
Step 6: For a detailed description of the volumes throw the below commands.
	*fdisk –l --->Enter
Step 7: If you want to check whether the disk is mounted to the server or not. You can use the below command.
	*df –hT --->Enter
Step 8: Using the following command, format the volume as xfs filesystem.
	*mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf --->Enter
Step 9:- Create an extra directory of your choice to mount out a new xfs volume. I am using the name /mnt/my-volume. You can name it something of your choice.
	*mkdir /mnt/my-volume --->Enter
Step 10:- Mount the volume to the /extra directory using the following command.
	* mount /dev/xvdf /mnt/my-volume --->Enter
Note:-
Now with df -h command you can check whether it is mounted or not. By using the below command you can go into the extra directory and can create files.

	* cd /
	* Touch  file{1..5}.txt

==>Now here is the problem if you stop and start your instance the data will be gone… So we have to permanently mount the volume.

       Permanently Mount The Volume To The Instance.

	Then log in to the vim editor firing the below command.

	* vim /etc/fstab

	Write the path where you want to mount and the filesystem you format.

	*/dev/xvdf  /mnt/my-volume  xfs defaults 0 0

That’s it your file is permanently mounted. Now if you stop your instance and start again your data won’t be lost.
